in article email email kouhia juhana write in article email email write in article email email kouhia juhana write write something about make color modification quickly with 8bit quantize image and only at the save the image to file process we have to make the modification to the 24bit image this make sense because the main use of xv be only view image do many change to image we should keep all modification in buffer and then before make the operation to 24bit image we should [UNK] the operation list for unnecessary operation think about what you be say here the twenty four bit image be quantise down to eight bit so many similar colour be map onto single palette colour this colour get modify in fairly arbitrary way you then want to apply these modification back to the twenty four bit file so you have to find which colour map to this one palette colour suppose you do not know what about we have discuss we discuss about [UNK] in xv two point two one which show image only as 8bit and my suggestion above work perfectly with it look be consistent first you post something that seem to suggest that you see xv be an eight bit program as some sort of error so post and [UNK] it be not bug it be mean to be like that so you post and say it be not bug you never say it be have misunderstood etc now you be say we discuss about [UNK] in xv two point two one which show image only as 8bit if you would make up your mind what you be claim it would make the discussion lot easy so far have see colormap editing window in xv that be there must be colormap anyway the problem you present be exist anyway and do not try to solve they at all because would not make such problem to my program in the first place [UNK] sorry do not understand what you be say here be aware that english be not your native language and have try hard to [UNK] your meaning but this paragraph defeat gamma and color correction be easily do to 24bit image as present there be no need make trick from 8bit quantize image back to twenty four bit image yes as originally say global change be easily possible but this statement [UNK] what you say early write something about make color modification quickly with 8bit quantize image and only at the save the image to file process we have to make the modification to the 24bit image how would you suggest do colour editing on twenty four bit file how would you group relate colour to edit they together only global change could be do unless the software be very different and much more complicated ok you be write about situation that user want edit image as 24bit and user want edit individual color your question by the way jump off the discussion bit no do not think so actually you be talk about load twenty four bit image into xv by quantise manipulate the colour in the colour editor then [UNK] apply these change to the twenty four bit file when you exit xv xv let you edit individual colour where be this sudden jump off the topic my solution do not work because there be no colormap [UNK] real 24bit image yes be aware there be no [UNK] in twenty four bit file you see user see 24bit image go back to 8bit be silly do not understand what this statement be suppose to mean about change individual color in 8bit quantize rasterize image change individual color in colormap be useless in most case if the image be quantize and rasterize small change may make serious error to anywhere in the image what be you say xv allow this feature but do not recommend to use it with the [UNK] type image [UNK] now we see [UNK] problem first you want to extend xv to allow editing of eight bit preview of twenty four bit image then point out problem with this now you be say there be no problem because you personally happen not to use those part of the program that cause the problem moreover xv be not paint program you can only make those global change not sure what you be say here certainly one can make local change in full 24bit xv change individual color sound like paint program job if person have 8bit screen there be need for trick to get the original 24bit image modify because user do not see full 24bit image there be need to make approximation and it be not possible to modify individual color but individual pixel or pixel group if image be rasterize to select [UNK] color there could be [UNK] cursor window which show true color image in cursor window area select individual color be possible from that yes that be one possible approach would find program that take such an approach [UNK] however ok do not have think very much 24bit painting program never see such in good view and be not plan to make such not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen well here we agree you have not think it through very much you do not seem to have consistent point to make and [UNK] yourself from one post to the next ok we all have off day perhaps you should step back and think this one through yes again what be be wrong with xv it save 8bit quantize rasterize image as 24bit jpeg jpeg be not design for that as say in the last post jpeg be compression algorithm it be way of save disk space by trade off quality against compression fail to see what the problem be you have not propose any workable alternative also human expect that 24bit will be save as 24bit image speak for yourself you be the only person have meet or speak to who have quantise twenty four bit image down to eight bit expect this process to somehow reverse when the file be save keep all [UNK] that [UNK] be make to the eight bit image palette perhaps that be why you [UNK] the [UNK] say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it be expect that the image still be the same look next time you import twenty four bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel it tell you how many colour have be allocate to the eight bit image xv make it [UNK] clear that you be not edit the original twenty four bit file you be the only person who claim this be confuse so xv be design without think about human interface and how human expect the program work design error be design error the same as bug read my [UNK] xv be program for view and modify eight bit image it let you import other image it show would say good deal of thought about the human interface and everyone else seem to use it [UNK] for the purpose it be design for it make no false claim have hear xv be design first for 8bit image file but it be not good idea to take full 24bit image without make major change to the original design if you would come up with solid logical well argue and [UNK] description of precisely how these propose extension would work feel free to post they so far you have not do so so even all screen image be 8bit the process image and save image could have be 24bit very easily instead of 8bit [UNK] after all this comment like that very easily ok go ahead and code it if it be so easy or alternatively look up the term import and non reversible transformation before anybody will make note yes may as well make lift where up mean that the lift go down and down mean that the lift go up and put note on this design solution to the manual however

to sun though there be rumor there be always rumor that the software would be port to pc and possibly sun environment company call pci inc out of richmond hill ontario canada make an array of software utility for processing manipulation and use of remote sense datum in eight or ten different industry standard format [UNK] [UNK] landsat and couple of other whose title forget the software be available in version for ms [UNK] unix workstation among they hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly other platform by now use the vms version the pci software consist of several class group package of utility group by function but all operate on common pci database disk file the tape package be set of utility program which read from the various remote sense industry tape format into or write those format out from the pci database file this be the only package use or know much about other package can display datum from the pci database to one or another of several pci support third party color display output [UNK] or bitmap representation of image datum to an [UNK] printer e.g. an [UNK] type dot matrix graphic printer you might be more [UNK] [UNK] interested in the [UNK] operation package [UNK] gram and [UNK] analysis [UNK] user specify operation e.g. multiply channel one by three add channel two and store as channel five and god only know what all else there be lot do not have and do not use these so can not say much about they you only buy the package your particular application interest call for each utility be control by from one to eight parameter read from common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default directory some utility will share parameter and use the same parameter for different purpose so it can get bit confusing set up series of operation the standard pci environment contain script language very similar to ibm pc basic but which allow you to automate the process of set up parameter for common complicated lengthy or difficult series of utility execution in vms can also invoke utility independently from [UNK] command procedure there be also an optional programming library which allow you to write compile language program which can interface with read from write to the pci data structure database file parameter file the pci software be design specifically for remote sense image but require such level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle image you can figure out way to handle few other thing as well for instance the tape package offer utility for read [UNK] multi band what adobe photoshop on the macintosh call raw datum from tape in number of different [UNK] order this turn out to be ideal for manipulate the graphic art industry 's [UNK] format would probably have not try handle [UNK] and so on above all however you have to know what you be do or you can [UNK] up to the [UNK] degree and have to start over it be worth note that the pci database file be design to contain not only raster image datum but vector for overlay map information enter via digitize table land use and all manner of other information observe that remote sense image tape often contain all manner of information about the spectral band [UNK] longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this can go into the pci database believe that on workstation the build in

user i.e. those for whom mac pc largely do not [UNK] although as you know the gap be get small all the time it be probably no coincidence that pci be locate in canada country which do lot of its land

august [UNK] yet this abortive french offensive have an indirect effect on the german plan for when the french attack in lorraine developed moltke be tempt [UNK] to postpone the right wing sweep and instead to seek victory in lorraine this [UNK] impulse lead he to divert to lorraine the six newly form ersatz division that have be intend to increase the weight of his right wing this be the first

prove [UNK] to [UNK] their opportunity for personal glory crown prince [UNK] of [UNK] on august twenty order his six army to counterattack instead of continue to fall back before the french advance as

and four army on the right and the five support by the bef on the left to trap the germans in the meuse ardenne area south of liège the fundamental flaw in this new french plan be that the germans have deploy about fifty percent more troop than the french have estimate and for [UNK] enveloping movement consequently while the right hand claw of the french pincer twenty three division collide with the german five and four army twenty division in the ardenne and be throw back the left hand claw thirteen french and four british division find itself nearly trap between the german one and two army with total of thirty division on the one hand and the three on the other as the french five army under general charles lanrezac be check in its offensive south of the [UNK] river by german attack on august twenty one the british who reach mon on august twenty two at first agree to stand there to cover lanrezac ’s leave but on august twenty three news of the fall of namur and of the german three army ’s presence near [UNK] induce lanrezac to wisely order general retreat and on august twenty four the british begin their retreat from mon just in time to escape envelopment by the german one army ’s westward march around their unprotected left flank at last joffre realize the truth and the utter collapse of plan [UNK] resolution be his great asset and with [UNK] [UNK] he form new plan out of the [UNK] joffre decide to swing the ally centre and leave back southwestward from the belgian frontier to line [UNK] on the french fortress of verdun and at the same time to withdraw some strength from the right wing so as to be able to station newly create six army on the extreme left north of paris this plan might in turn have collapse if the germans have not themselves depart from schlieffen ’s original plan due to combination of moltke ’s [UNK] poor communication between his headquarters and the field army commander of the german right wing and moltke ’s result confusion about the develop tactical situation in the first place the german right wing be weaken by the [UNK] of eleven division four be detach to watch antwerp and to invest french fortress near the belgian frontier instead of use reserve and ersatz troop for this as early intend and seven more regular division be transfer to check the russian advance into east prussia see below in the second place alexander von kluck in command of the one army do in fact wheel inward north of paris rather than southwest of the city kluck ’s change of direction mean the inevitable abandonment of the original wide sweep around the far western side of paris now the flank of this [UNK] german line would pass the near side of paris and across the face of the paris defense into the valley of the marne river the premature inward wheel of kluck ’s one army before paris have be reach thus expose the german extreme right wing to flank attack and possible counter envelopment on september four moltke decide to abandon the original schlieffen plan and substitute new one the german four and five army should drive southeastward from the ardenne into french lorraine west of verdun and then converge with the southwestward advance of the six and seven army from alsace against the [UNK] [UNK] line of fortification so as to envelop the whole french right wing the one and two army in the marne valley should stand guard meanwhile against any french [UNK] from the vicinity of paris but such an allied [UNK] have already begin before the new german plan could be put into effect learn more the first battle of the marne already on september three general [UNK] gallieni the military governor of paris have guess the significance of the german one army ’s swing inward to the marne east of paris on september four joffre convince by gallieni ’s argument decisively order his whole left wing to turn about from their retreat and to begin general offensive against the germans expose right flank on september six the french six army under [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] by gallieni have actually begin attack on september five and its pressure cause kluck finally to engage the whole one army in support of his right flank when he be still no far up the marne valley than [UNK] with nothing but cavalry screen stretch across the thirty mile between he and karl von bülow ’s two army at [UNK] while the french five army be turn to attack bülow the bef between the five and the six army be still continue its retreat for another day but on september nine bülow learn that the british too have turn and be advance into the

counterattack by the entire left and centre of the french army this counterattack be know as the first battle of the marne by september eleven the german retreat extend to all the german army there be several reason for this extraordinary turn of event chief among they be the utter exhaustion of the german [UNK] of the right wing some of whom have march more than one hundred and fifty mile two hundred and forty kilometre under condition of frequent battle their fatigue be ultimately by product of the schlieffen plan itself for while the retreat french have be able to move troop by rail to various point within the circle form by the front the german troop have find their advance hamper by [UNK] bridge and destroy rail line their food and ammunition supply be consequently restrict and the troop also have to make their advance by foot moreover the germans have underestimate the [UNK] spirit of the french troop who have maintain their courage and morale and their confidence in their commander this fact be [UNK] evidence by the comparatively small number of prisoner take by the germans in the course of what be [UNK] [UNK] french retreat meanwhile the assault by the german six and

when its artillery open an intense bombardment on two thousand yard front and then after thirty five minute [UNK] its range so that the attack british infantry behind the second screen of shell could overrun the trench ravage by the first but the experiment ’s immediate result be merely loss of life both because shortage of munition make the second barrage inadequate and because there be five hour

which carbon date show be from between eleven thirty and one thousand bc be genetically much more similar to modern domesticate variety than to modern wild one suggest that the plant [UNK] the sample

modern variety could help make they more sustainable or more drought resistant scott say though he admit that this be very much just an idea the detection of ancient genetic variation be notable achievement because wheat genome be large three to five time the length of human genome and repetitive make the analysis incredibly complex say james [UNK] head of the [UNK] core at the south

major development in nineteen sixteen the western front nineteen sixteen in nineteen fourteen the centre of gravity of world war have be on the western front in nineteen fifteen it shift to the

by germany be to [UNK] this scheme and only the british offensive come fully into operation by the winter of 1915–16 falkenhayn regard russia as [UNK] and italy as [UNK] he consider the time at last [UNK] for positive action against france after whose collapse great britain would have no effective military ally on the european continent and would be bring to term rather by submarine warfare than by land operation for his offensive in the west however falkenhayn clung always to his method of attrition he believe that mass breakthrough be unnecessary and that instead the germans should aim to

be choose because it be menace to the main german line of communication because it be within french salient and thus cramp the defender and because of the certainty that the french would sacrifice any

north and east of verdun and its [UNK] fortress and then to stage continuous series of limited infantry advance upon the fort these advance would draw the french infantry into defend or try to [UNK] the fort in the process of which they would be [UNK] by german artillery fire in addition each german infantry advance would have its way smooth by brief but extremely intense artillery bombardment

british patrol to the south at [UNK] pm on this report beatty order his ship northward to lure the germans toward the grand fleet under jellicoe ’s command not until [UNK] pm after jellicoe ’s squadron and beatty ’s have be within sight of one another for nearly quarter of an hour be the german fleet precisely locate only just in time for jellicoe to deploy his ship to the good advantage jellicoe array the grand fleet end to end in line so that their combine broadside could be bring to bear on the approach german ship who could in turn reply only with the forward gun of their lead ship the british ship in effect form the horizontal stroke and the german ship the vertical stroke of the letter with the british having deploy into line at right angle to the german ship forward progress this maneuver be in fact know as cross the enemy ’s and be the ideal situation dream of by the [UNK] of both navy since by cross the one ’s force temporarily gain an overwhelming superiority of firepower for the german this be moment of [UNK] risk three factor help prevent the destruction of the german ship in this trap their own excellent construction the [UNK] and discipline of their

and they fight back to such effect that one of their [UNK] fall full on the [UNK] and blow it up this success however do little to relieve the intense bombardment from the other british ship and the german fleet be still press forward into the steel trap of the grand fleet rely on the magnificent [UNK] of the german crew scheer [UNK] his fleet from the [UNK] danger into which it have run by simple but in practice extremely difficult maneuver at [UNK] pm he order turn of one hundred and eighty for all his ship at once it be execute without [UNK] and the german battleship reverse course in unison and steam out of the jaw of the trap while german destroyer spread smoke screen across their rear the smoke and worsen [UNK] leave jellicoe in doubt about what have happen and the british have lose contact with the germans by [UNK] pm yet the british grand fleet have maneuver in such way that it end up between the german high sea fleet and the german port and this be the situation scheer most [UNK] so at [UNK] pm scheer order another reverse turn perhaps hope to pass around the rear of the british fleet but the result for he be bad position than that from which he have just escape his battle line have become compress and his lead ship find themselves again under intense bombardment from the broadside array of the british ship jellicoe have succee in cross the german again the [UNK] now receive [UNK] damage and many other german ship be damage at this point at [UNK] pm therefore to cause diversion and win time scheer order his battle cruiser and destroyer ahead to virtually [UNK] themselves in mass charge against the british ship this be the crisis of the battle of jutland as the german battle cruiser and destroyer steam forward the german battleship [UNK] become confused and [UNK] in try to execute their reverse turn have jellicoe order the grand fleet forward through the screen of charge german battle cruiser at that moment the fate of the german high sea fleet would likely have be seal as it be fear and [UNK] the danger of torpedo attack from the approach destroyer he order his fleet to turn away and the two line of battleship steam apart at speed of more than twenty [UNK] they do not meet again and when darkness fall jellicoe could not be sure of the route of the german retreat by [UNK] am on june one the germans have safely elude their [UNK] the british

in the battle of jutland the germans lose one battleship one battle cruiser four light cruiser five destroyer and two thousand five hundred and forty five officer and man the loss inflict on the

appeal to the russians for action to draw the enemy ’s reserve away from the italian front and the russians respond by advance their timetable again brusilov undertake to start his attack on june four on the understanding that evert ’s should be launch ten day later thus begin an offensive on the eastern front that be to be imperial russia ’s last really effective military effort popularly know as

invasion of the soviet union nineteen forty one for the campaign against the soviet union the germans [UNK] almost one hundred and fifty division contain total of about three million man among these be nineteen panzer division and in total the barbarossa force have about three thousand tank seven thousand artillery piece and two thousand five hundred aircraft it be in effect the large and most powerful invasion force in human history the germans strength be far increase by more than thirty division of finnish and romanian troop the soviet union have twice or perhaps three time the number of both tank and aircraft as the germans have but their aircraft be mostly obsolete the soviet tank be about equal to those of the germans however great hindrance to hitler ’s chance of victory be that the german intelligence service underestimate the troop reserve that stalin could bring up from the depth of the u.s.s.r the germans correctly estimate that there be about one hundred and fifty division in the western part of the u.s.s.r and reckon that fifty more might be produce but the soviet actually bring up more than two hundred fresh division by the middle of august make total of three hundred and sixty the consequence be that though the germans succeed in shatter the original soviet army by superior technique they then find their path block by fresh one the effect of the [UNK] be increase because much of august be waste while hitler and his adviser be have long argument as to what course they should follow after their initial victory another factor in the germans calculation be purely political though no less [UNK] they believe that within three to six month of their invasion the soviet regime would collapse from lack of domestic support the german attack on the soviet union be to have an immediate and highly [UNK] effect on great britain ’s situation until then britain ’s prospect have appear [UNK] in the eye of most people except the british themselves and the government ’s decision to continue the struggle after the fall of france and to reject hitler ’s peace offer could spell only slow suicide unless relief come from either the united states or the u.s.s.r hitler bring great britain relief by turn eastward and invade the soviet union just as the strain on britain be become severe on june twenty two nineteen forty one the german offensive be launch by three army group under the same commander as in the invasion of france in nineteen forty on the left north an army group under leeb strike from east prussia into the baltic state toward leningrad on the right south another army group under rundstedt with an armoured group under kleist advance from southern poland into the ukraine against kiev [UNK] it be to wheel southeastward to the coast of the black sea and the sea of [UNK] and in the centre north of the [UNK] [UNK] the main blow be deliver by bock ’s army group with one armoured group under guderian and another under hoth thrust [UNK] at smolensk and moscow the invasion along one thousand eight hundred mile front take the soviet leadership completely by surprise and catch the red army in an [UNK] and partially [UNK] state pierce the northern border guderian ’s tank race fifty mile beyond the frontier on the first day of the invasion and be at minsk two hundred mile beyond it on june twenty seven at minsk they converge with hoth ’s tank which have pierce the opposite flank but bock ’s infantry could not follow up quickly enough to complete the encirclement of the soviet troop in the area though three hundred thousand prisoner be take in the salient large part of the soviet force be able to escape to the east the soviet army be [UNK] handle and [UNK] their tank strength away in [UNK] action like that of the french in nineteen forty but the isolated soviet troop fight with [UNK] that the french have not show and their resistance impose brake by continue to block road centre long after the german tide have sweep past they the result be similar when guderian ’s tank having cross the dnieper river on july ten enter smolensk six day later and converge with hoth ’s thrust through [UNK] two hundred thousand soviet prisoner be take but some soviet force be withdraw from the trap to the line of the [UNK] and large pocket of resistance lie behind the german armour by mid july moreover series of [UNK] be turn the sandy russian road into clog mud over which the [UNK] vehicle of the german transport behind the tank could make only very slow progress the germans also begin to be hamper by the scorch earth policy adopt by the retreat soviet the soviet troop burn crop destroy bridge and evacuate factory in the face of the german advance entire steel and munition plant in the [UNK] portion of the u.s.s.r be [UNK] and ship by rail to the east where they be put back into production the soviet also destroy or evacuate most of their roll stock railroad car thus deprive the germans of the use of the soviet rail system since soviet railroad track be of different [UNK] than german track and german roll stock be consequently useless on it nevertheless by mid july the germans have advance more than four hundred mile and be only two hundred mile from moscow they still have ample time to make decisive gain before the onset of winter but they lose the opportunity primarily because of argument throughout august between hitler and the [UNK] about the destination of the next thrust [UNK] whereas the [UNK] propose moscow as the main objective hitler want the major effort to be direct southeastward through the ukraine and the [UNK] basin into the caucasus with minor swing northwestward against leningrad to converge with leeb ’s army group in the ukraine meanwhile rundstedt and kleist have make short work of the foremost soviet defense strong though the latter have be new soviet front south of kiev be break by the end of july and in the next fortnight the germans sweep down to the black sea mouth of the bug and dnieper river to converge with romania ’s simultaneous offensive kleist be then order to wheel northward from the ukraine guderian southward from smolensk for pincer movement around the soviet force behind kiev and by the end of september the claw of the encircle movement have catch five hundred and twenty thousand man these [UNK] encirclement be partly the fault of [UNK] soviet high commander and partly the fault of stalin who as commander in chief stubbornly [UNK] the advice of his general and order his army to stand and fight instead of allow they to retreat eastward and [UNK] in preparation for counteroffensive winter be approach and hitler stop leeb ’s northward drive on the outskirt of leningrad he order rundstedt and kleist however to press on from the dnieper toward the don and the caucasus and bock be to resume the advance on moscow bock ’s renew advance on moscow begin on october two nineteen forty one its prospect look bright when bock ’s army bring off great encirclement around vyazma where six hundred thousand more soviet troop be capture that leave the germans [UNK] with an almost clear path to moscow but the vyazma battle have not be complete until late october the german troop be tired the country become [UNK] as the weather get bad and fresh soviet force appear in the path as they [UNK] slowly forward some of the german general want to break off the offensive and to take up suitable winter line but bock want to press on believe that the soviet be on the verge of collapse while brauchitsch and [UNK] tend to agree with his view as that also accord with hitler ’s desire he make no objection the [UNK] of moscow now so close in front of their eye be too great for any of the [UNK] leader to resist on december two further effort be launch and some german detachment penetrate into the suburb of moscow but the advance as whole be hold up in the forest cover the capital the [UNK] of this last phase of the great german offensive be partly due to the effect of the russian winter whose [UNK] temperature be the most severe in several decade in october and november wave of [UNK] case have decimate the ill clothe german troop for whom provision of winter clothing have not be make while the [UNK] cold paralyze the germans [UNK] transport tank artillery and aircraft the soviet by contrast be well clothe and tend to fight more effectively in winter than do the germans by this time german casualty have mount to level that be [UNK] of in the campaign against france and the balkan by november the germans have suffer about seven hundred and thirty thousand casualty in the south kleist have already reach [UNK] on don gateway to the caucasus on november twenty two but have exhaust his tank fuel in do so rundstedt see the place to be [UNK] want to evacuate it but be overrule by hitler soviet counteroffensive recapture [UNK] on november twenty eight and rundstedt be relieve of his command four day later the germans however manage to establish front on the [UNK] river as rundstedt have recommend as the german drive against moscow [UNK] the soviet commander on the moscow front general [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] on december six inaugurate the first great counteroffensive with stroke against bock ’s right in the [UNK] [UNK] and [UNK] sector south of moscow and against his centre in the [UNK] and [UNK] sector to the [UNK] levy of [UNK] troop who be extremely effective fighter in cold weather be use for these offensive there follow blow at the german leave in the [UNK] [UNK] sector and the counteroffensive which be sustain throughout the winter of [UNK] soon take the form of triple [UNK] toward smolensk these soviet counteroffensive tumble back the exhausted germans lap around their flank and produce critical situation from general downward the invader be fill with [UNK] thought of napoleon ’s retreat from moscow in that emergency hitler forbid any retreat beyond the [UNK] possible local withdrawal his decision expose his troop to awful suffering in their advanced position face moscow for they have neither the clothing nor the equipment for russian winter campaign but if they have once start general retreat it might easily have [UNK] into panic [UNK] [UNK] the red army ’s winter counteroffensive continue for more than three month after its december [UNK] though with diminish progress by march nineteen forty two it have advance more than one hundred and fifty mile in some sector but the germans maintain their hold on the main bastion of their winter front such town as [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] vyazma [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] and [UNK] despite the fact that the soviet have often advance many mile beyond these bastion which be in effect cut off in [UNK] it become clear that hitler ’s veto on any extensive withdrawal work out in such way as to restore the confidence of the german troop and probably save they from widespread collapse nevertheless they pay heavy price [UNK] for that [UNK] defense one immediate [UNK] be that the strength of the luftwaffe be drain in the prolong effort to maintain supply by air under winter condition to the garrison of these more or less isolated bastion town the tremendous strain of that winter campaign on army which have not be prepare for it have other serious effect before the winter end many german division be reduce to barely third of their original strength and they be never fully build up again the german plan of campaign have begin to [UNK] in august nineteen forty one and its failure be patent when the soviet counteroffensive start nevertheless having dismiss brauchitsch and appoint himself army commander in chief in december hitler persist in overrule the [UNK] opposition of the general staff to

how the algerian war shape french city the algerian war of independence which coincide with turning point in france ’s urban history have significant influence on the future of french city [UNK] explore the role of conflict in their development the second half of the nineteen fifty be crucial period of change in the history of french urban policy it be at this time that urban renewal slum clearance and the construction of large social housing estate begin and yet these policy be implement while the country be at war even if the colonial conflict in algeria be never officially designate as such recent research have show that this context of war be decisive factor in the orientation of these public policy which would [UNK] mark the appearance and population of french city as well as the administrative practice involve in manage these urban area to commemorate the fifty anniversary of the end of the conflict [UNK] explore in this series of article the algerian origin of modern french city which be so often forget as result of limited crossover between the discipline of urban study and the history of the algerian war the war lead to considerable level of migration from algeria to mainland france which raise the question of how to accommodate these migrant population as the conflict come to an end the french government have to find solution to house its [UNK] citizen whose experience would be different from those of other population group while the arrival in nineteen sixty two of six hundred thousand pie noir one which lead in no small part to the radical modification of certain french city incite intense home building operation large proportion of the ninety thousand harki two evacuate to france be for long time house in isolate area the war also lead to an increase in the number of french muslim from algeria as the french administration call they follow the [UNK] of nineteen forty five that give they french citizenship whose presence in mainland france concern the public authority they be the target of the force [UNK] policy of the two major and rival [UNK] party namely the fln front de libération nationale or national liberation front and the mna mouvement national algérien or national algerian movement control these group be therefore an important police objective during the war this mean control the place where they live which be both concentrated and [UNK] area of algerian housing in mainland france thus become the subject of specific measure implement by the various force of order for the french administration these strategy seek to simultaneously [UNK] what appear to be rear basis for the fln control the population concern and educate these population or integrate they into mainland life numerous urban planning and housing policy be put into place to meet this triple objective the clearance of bidonville shanty town the [UNK] of former slum neighbourhood the creation of [UNK] de transit temporary settlement for

in term of policing and urban and social project be [UNK] link during this period military history converge with the history of urban planning and that of social policy and not only create the condition necessary for the implementation of such policy but also influence the policy themselves the algerian conflict also explain the observable [UNK] between colonial and mainland practice in term of settlement pattern and the way in which certain population group be control moreover one of the major development in recent research lie in the [UNK] of this link for example the bidonville clearance operation in colonial city and mainland city would appear to have common colonial [UNK] that go back to experience in the nineteen thirty if not far still this recycling of practice be possible as result of administrative structure that be inspire by one another as well as the circulation of colonial civil servant who be recruit as expert advisor for the implementation of policy intend to control and educate algerian recently arrive on the mainland indeed many of those responsible for social urban and police policy in mainland france during and after the war begin their career in the colonial administration the two most [UNK] case be without doubt maurice papon who be appoint [UNK] of police head of the paris police with many responsibility currently hold by the city

in recent research it be primarily because the bidonville in mainland france be [UNK] by algerian that action be take to eradicate they furthermore police priority have an influence on the way their inhabitant be [UNK] moreover the practice devise at this time to deal with bidonville continue to be apply after the war the [UNK] of the portuguese shanty town at [UNK] [UNK] marne in the eastern

how the first world war end professor david [UNK] explain how the war come to an end and why germany accept the harsh term of the armistice to understand how and why the first world war [UNK] we

widely to allow peace through compromise and domestic political until the bolshevik revolution of november nineteen seventeen government in all the great power belligerent remain committed to victory in contrast on the eastern front the crucial development which enable soviet russia ’s withdrawal from the war [UNK] by the signing of the br litovsk peace treaty of march nineteen eighteen be that majority of the bolshevik leader be willing to concede all the central power demand rather than risk be [UNK] in any case much of the russian army desert after the bolshevik takeover render organise

military once the strategic balance shift decisively germany apply for ceasefire and for peace settlement base on the american president woodrow wilson ’s fourteen point of january nineteen eighteen which germany have initially reject only after the german government have publicly admit that the war could not be win do revolution follow and rule out further resistance to the victor term germany in nineteen eighteen be not [UNK] but the army high command paul von hindenburg as chief of the general staff and erich ludendorff as first quartermaster general hold veto over key decision in foreign policy wilhelm ii fear confront they and by threaten to resign they could remove official whom they think too moderate the key development on the road to the armistice therefore come on twenty eight september when ludendorff suffer breakdown that evening he tell hindenburg that an early ceasefire be imperative and hindenburg agree ludendorff have be under strain for month but development in the balkan france and in the german army precipitate his collapse the trigger be ceasefire appeal by germany ’s small partner start on fifteen september ally force in macedonia have attack and route the bulgarian army if bulgaria drop out the central power would [UNK] split in two separate ottoman turkey from austria hungary and germany in addition ally force could threaten the [UNK] [UNK] in romania bulgaria therefore matter in its own right but it surrender partly because of wide development in the war german and austro hungarian force have withdraw from macedonia to fight elsewhere and the balkan crisis coincide with large crisis on the western front between march and july nineteen eighteen five german all out assault the ludendorff offensive have advance up to fifty mile eighty kilometre towards the channel port and paris but compel neither britain nor france to make peace before the american army arrive in strength between july and november the ally drive germany back expel it from most of france and much of belgium on twenty six september ally force open sequence of attack along huge sector between the argonne forest and flander and on twenty nine september british empire troop break through the strong german defence position the hindenburg line the german army could neither overwhelm its enemy in an all out offensive nor halt their advance through defensive attrition the situation on the western front have alter fundamentally since the stalemate of [UNK] ally advantage technology be one factor the ally possess hundred of tank against germany ’s dozen the german high command cite tank as one reason why ceasefire be need they be use in mass attack on the marne on eighteen july and near [UNK] on eight august yet the tank advance only at walk pace and be vulnerable to breakdown and to german fire they be supplementary advantage rather than war win weapon more important be ally artillery this mean particularly heavy gun which could destroy trench and [UNK] and if guide by aerial reconnaissance and photograph could silence germany ’s gun by surprise bombardment at the same time light field gun battery lie down creep barrage that stifle the german

italy at the paris conference of twenty nine [UNK] november just as it have take two side to start the war so too all the party have to be persuade that stop the conflict be in their interest even so it be less surprising that the germans request ceasefire than that the americans and the european ally concede one when at last the military operation be move their way part of the explanation for this paradox be that america britain and france be wary of each other as well as of their enemy and all see argument against continue into nineteen nineteen in washington the issue be partly financial treasury secretary william [UNK] warn that the war be become [UNK] expensive even for america moreover wilson face [UNK] election in which his democratic party be likely to lose ground to his republican critic he fear the [UNK] of the american home front would hamper he in broker moderate peace this would apply still more if germany be so completely beat that britain and france no long need american assistance in europe in contrast italy would follow franco british lead and both paris and london fear that victory win in nineteen nineteen would be dominate by america which would gain corresponding dominance at the peace conference and although wilson insist on the fourteen point become the political framework of the armistice he leave the technical term to the european ally the

foch who require the germans to withdraw so quickly that they abandon much of their heavy equipment enable the ally to occupy belgium central british concern alsace lorraine central french one and the

to which they have [UNK] and to weaken germany to such an extent that it could not renew hostility why do germany accept an armistice with such severe term the question remain why germany accept term that be much less favourable than hindenburg and ludendorff have envisage part of the answer be that wilhelm ii dismiss ludendorff on seventeen october while order hindenburg to stay in post and thereby split the two general as ludendorff be replace by the more [UNK] and realistic wilhelm [UNK] the military veto over foreign policy be lift ludendorff lose credibility with the german

further proof of hiv gene involvement come from test in which the scientist expose the transgenic animal to ultraviolet light the light increase hiv genetic activity cause papilloma to develop on

to investigator at the [UNK] health sciences university in [UNK] have serious implication for public health in both [UNK] and develop country this study demonstrate why we can develop coronary heart disease and have high blood cholesterol and triglyceride level it show also the importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body weight thereby lead to whole host of other health problem in develop country and affluent nation as well explain principal investigator dr william e. connor head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at [UNK] health sciences university over the past twenty five year dr connor and his team have characterize the food and nutrient intake of the tara [UNK] indians in mexico while simultaneously document various aspect of tarahumara lipid metabolism these native mexican number approximately fifty thousand and reside in the sierra [UNK] [UNK] mountain in the state of [UNK] the tarahumara have couple an [UNK] diet to [UNK] race probably as result coronary heart disease which be so prevalent in western [UNK] nation be virtually non [UNK] in their culture [UNK] translate the name tarahumara mean fleet of

contain approximately twelve percent of total calorie as fat of which the majority sixty nine percent be of vegetable origin dietician [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] in the study describe their diet as simple and very rich in nutrient while low in cholesterol and fat the tarahumara have average plasma cholesterol level of one hundred and twenty one [UNK] dl low density lipoprotein [UNK] level of seventy two mg

cholesterol triglyceride and lipoprotein [UNK] regular measurement include participant body weight height and [UNK] skin fold [UNK] thirteen tarahumara five woman and eight man include one adolescent be feed their native diet for one week follow by five week of an affluent diet in this study we go up to concentration of dietary fat that be forty percent of total calorie this be the [UNK] of the holiday diet that many americans consume diet high in fat sugar and cholesterol low in fiber [UNK] dr [UNK] such dietary characteristic be reflect in the cholesterol saturation index or csi recently devise research [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] work with dr connor the csi be single number that incorporate both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturate fat in the diet csi indicate the diet 's potential to elevate the cholesterol level particularly the ldl dr connor explain the [UNK] diet average very low csi of twenty dr connor 's affluent diet use in the study rank csi of one hundred and forty nine the experimental design of this study reflect the importance of establish baseline plasma lipid level typical of the native diet before expose subject to the experimental diet the standard curve relate dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrate level off or plateau for consumption of large amount of fat change in dietary fat and/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma level you must have the baseline diet almost free of the variable you be go to put into the experimental diet the [UNK] study for example do not discriminate on the basis of diet between individual who get heart disease because the diet be already high in fat all subject be already eat on plateau dr connor say after five week of consume the affluent diet the subject mean plasma cholesterol level have in [UNK] by thirty one percent primarily in the ldl fraction which rise thirty nine percent hdl cholesterol increase by thirty one per cent and ldl to hdl ratio change therefore very little plasma triglyceride level increase by eighteen percent and subject average an eight pound gain in weight accord to dr connor lipid change occur surprisingly soon yield nearly the same result after seven day of affluent diet as after thirty five day hicnet medical newsletter page twenty one volume six number eleven april twenty five nineteen ninety three the increase in hdl carry broad dietary implication for [UNK] nation we think hdl cholesterol increase because we increase the amount of dietary fat over the fat content use in the previous tarahumara metabolic study in that study we see no change in hdl level after raise the dietary cholesterol but keep the fat relatively consistent with native consumption in the present study we increase fat intake to forty percent of the total calorie we reach the conclusion in the tarahumara study that hdl reflect the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary cholesterol hdl must increase to help [UNK] the fat and it increase quite bit in this study dr connor explain low hdl in the [UNK] be not typically an important [UNK] of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amount of fat or cholesterol hdl remain an important [UNK] to americans because of their usual high fat intake dr connor recommend diet for americans that contain less than twenty percent of total calorie as fat less than one hundred mg of cholesterol and csi around twenty [UNK] in accordance with [UNK] need such diet be low in meat and dairy fat high in fiber dr connor also comment on recent suggestion that americans adopt mediterranean style diet the original mediterranean diet in its [UNK] state consist of very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy product we be already eat lot of meat and dairy product simply to continue that pattern while switch to olive oil be not go to help the situation the world health organization who be focus much attention on the [UNK] of disease such as coronary heart disease in nation and society undergo technological development dr connor say that coronary heart disease start with give society 's elite who typically eat different diet than the average citizen if the pattern of [UNK] increase the entire population will have have high incidence of coronary heart disease which place [UNK] health care burden on society who would like the develop country to prevent coronary heart disease so they can concentrate on other aspect of their economic development and on public health measure to improve general well be rather than pay for unnecessary expensive medical technology dr connor say the overall implication of this study be that human can readily move their plasma lipid and lipoprotein value into high risk range within very short time by an affluent excessive diet the present rate of coronary heart disease in the united states be thirty percent less than it be twenty year ago so lot have be accomplish we be change

[UNK] [UNK] trouble be any vote he collect may just end up help new labour into third term whatever kilroy silk and ukip do none of their anti european policy have any relevance outside middle england this new party might gain support from right wing england but will have little impact in wale or scotland hopefully this all this fighting within euro sceptic party will allow they to slip out of the

having see the recent bbc three documentary and witness the thoroughly [UNK] [UNK] behaviour of number of senior ukip figure can well understand why kilroy silk feel [UNK] to be associate with such

ken jenks email the ascent guidance and flight control training manual [UNK] [UNK] two thousand one hundred and two say during the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude be command until an [UNK] [UNK] sufficient to assure launch tower clearance be achieve then the tilt maneuver roll program orient the vehicle to head down attitude require to generate negative alpha which in turn alleviate structural loading other advantage with this attitude be performance gain decrease abort maneuver complexity improve band look angle and crew view of the horizon the tilt maneuver be also require to start gain [UNK] velocity to achieve the main engine [UNK] [UNK] target in second stage this really be good answer but it be [UNK] in nasa [UNK] will try to interpret one we wait until the shuttle clear the tower before roll two then we roll the shuttle around so that the angle of attack between the wind cause by passage through the atmosphere the relative wind and the chord of the wing the imaginary line between the lead edge and the trail edge be slightly negative angle negative alpha this cause little bit of downward force toward the [UNK] of the orbiter or the direction and this force alleviate structural loading we have to be careful about those wing they be about the most delicate part of the vehicle three the new attitude after the roll also allow we to carry more mass to orbit or to achieve high orbit with the same mass or to change the orbit to high or low inclination than would be the case if we do not roll performance gain four the new attitude allow the crew to fly less complicated flight path if they have to execute one of the more dangerous abort maneuver the return to launch site decrease abort maneuver complexity five the new attitude improve the ability for ground base radio antennae to have good line of sight signal with the band radio antennae on the orbiter improve band look angle six the new attitude allow the crew to see the horizon which be helpful but not mandatory part of pilot any fly machine seven the new attitude orient the shuttle so that the body be more nearly parallel with the ground and the nose to the east usually this allow the thrust from the engine to add velocity in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit remember velocity be vector quantity make of both speed and direction the shuttle have to have large horizontal component to its velocity and very small vertical component to attain orbit this all [UNK] the question why be not the launch pad orient to give this nice attitude to begin with why do the shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude the answer be that the pad be [UNK] from the apollo day the shuttle [UNK] two flame trench one for the solid rocket motor exhaust one for the space shuttle main engine exhaust you can see the effect of this on any [UNK] launch the srm exhaust be dirty gray garbage and the [UNK] exhaust be [UNK] white steam watch for the difference between the top

be also have roll program do not ask why shuttle guy check with [UNK] in ascent dynamic he add that the roll maneuver be really maneuver in all three axis roll pitch and [UNK] the roll component of

the sister probe to mariner eight become the first craft to orbit mar in nineteen seventy one it return information on the red planet that no other probe have do before reveal huge volcano on the martian surface as well as giant [UNK] system and evidence that water once flow across the planet the probe also take the first detailed closeup image of mar two small moon phobo and [UNK] mariner ten use venu as gravity assist to mercury in nineteen seventy four the probe do return the first close up image of the venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet reveal previously [UNK] detail in the cloud cover plus the fact that the entire cloud system circle the planet in four earth day mariner ten eventually make three flyby of mercury from nineteen seventy four to nineteen seventy five before run out of

earth out to thirty six point two million kilometer in nineteen sixty record until mariner two pioneer six through nine be place into solar orbit from nineteen sixty five to nineteen sixty eight pioneer six seven and eight be still transmit information at this time pioneer would have be number ten suffer launch failure in nineteen sixty nine pioneer ten become the first spacecraft to flyby jupiter in nineteen seventy three pioneer eleven follow it in nineteen seventy four and then go on to become the first probe to study saturn in nineteen seventy nine both vehicle should continue to

none be expect to survive to the surface the day probe do make it and transmit for sixty seven point five minute on the ground before its battery fail ranger one and two be test probe for the ranger lunar impact series they be mean for high earth orbit testing in nineteen sixty one but rocket problem leave they in useless low orbit which quickly decay ranger three launch on january twenty six nineteen sixty two be intend to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the moon but problem during the launch cause the probe to miss the moon and head into solar orbit ranger three do try to take some image of the moon as it fly by but the camera be unfortunately aim at deep space during the attempt ranger four launch april twenty three nineteen sixty two have the same purpose as ranger three but suffer technical problem enroute and crash on the lunar farside the first u.s probe to reach the moon albeit without return datum ranger five launch october eighteen nineteen sixty two and similar to ranger three and four lose all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually miss the moon and drift off into solar orbit ranger six through nine have more [UNK] lunar mission they be to send back live image of the lunar surface as they head towards an impact with the moon ranger six fail this objective in nineteen sixty four when its camera do not operate ranger seven through nine perform well become the first u.s lunar probe to return thousand of lunar image through nineteen sixty five lunar orbiter one through five be design to orbit the moon and image various site be study as landing area for the man apollo mission of nineteen sixty nine nineteen seventy two the probe also contribute greatly to our understanding of lunar surface feature particularly the lunar farside all five probe of the series launch from nineteen sixty six to nineteen sixty seven be essentially successful in their mission they be the first u.s probe to orbit the moon all los be eventually crash into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the man apollo mission the surveyor series be design primarily to see if an apollo lunar module could land on the surface of the moon without sink into the soil before this time it be fear by some that the moon be cover in great layer of dust which would not support heavy landing vehicle surveyor be successful in prove that the lunar surface be strong enough to hold up spacecraft from nineteen sixty six to nineteen sixty eight only surveyor two and four be unsuccessful mission the rest become the first u.s probe to soft land on the moon take thousand of image and scoop the soil for analysis apollo twelve land six hundred foot from surveyor three in nineteen sixty nine and return part of the craft to earth surveyor seven the last of the series be purely scientific mission which explore the [UNK] crater region in nineteen sixty eight vike one be launch from cape canaveral florida on august twenty nineteen seventy five on titan [UNK] centaur [UNK] rocket the probe go into martian orbit on june nineteen nineteen seventy six and the lander set down on the western [UNK] of [UNK] [UNK] on july twenty nineteen seventy

main political party have oppose it but there be not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection early in december the british government hold consultation meeting with those who have comment on the proposal science minister lord [UNK] go along to listen and outline the uk position but accord to those present it be embarrassing to see how little the minister and his official actually understand the issue concern the draft directive be be put through the council as what be call an item and can only be approve or reject no discussion or amendment be allow so why should we be worry first there be the abuse of the democratic process involve in disregard the view of the parliament and abandon all of their carefully argue amendment this go to the heart of the european project and even those who do not care about software or patent should be worry if [UNK] be treat like this today who be to say that it will not be you tomorrow more directly once software patent be grant then any programmer will have to worry that the code they be write be infringe someone else 's patent this be not about steal software as code be already protect by copyright patent be not copyright but

at least in the us coincidence be no defence the propose directive be support by many of the major software company but this be hardly surprising since most of they be we base and they have already have to cope with legal environment that allow patent they have legal department and more crucially patent of their own which they can trade or cross license with other patent holder even this system break down of course as microsoft find out last year when they initially lose case bring by [UNK] which claim that internet explorer and other browser infringe an [UNK] patent that one be eventually throw out but only after month of uncertainty and million of dollar but small company and the free and open software movement do not have any patent to trade much of the really useful software we use every day program like the [UNK] web server the [UNK] linux operating system and the [UNK] popular firefox browser be develop outside company structure by people who do not have legal department to check for patent infringement the damage to software will not happen overnight of course if the directive go through it have to be write into national law and then there will be steady stream of legal action against small company and open source product eventually someone will decide to attack linux directly probably with some secret funding from one or two large player the new directive will limit innovation by force programmer to spend time check for patent infringement or simply avoid work in potentially competitive area and it will damage europe 's computer industry we can only hope that the
