Emily In Paris star Ashley Park has revealed she developed sepsis on a Christmas holiday to Thailand.

The 32-year-old, who plays Mindy Chen in the Netflix series, posted on Instagram that "what started as tonsillitis spiralled into critical septic shock" in December.

She said it "infected and affected several of her organs" and she spent "a week in the ICU".

Park's post also confirmed her relationship with her on-screen boyfriend, actor Paul Forman.


She wrote: "Grateful most of all to @peforman for being unconditionally by my side through all this.

"You calmed my fears and held me through ambulances, three foreign hospitals, a week in the ICU, scary ERs, countless scans and tests and injections, excruciating pain, and so much confusion all while we were alone on the other side of the world far from those we know.

"I love you Paul. More than I can ever say."

Her post was accompanied by a picture of Forman kissing her forehead while she lay in a hospital bed.

There was also a video clip of him tying her hair while connected to an oxygen machine.

Forman replied, saying: "My love" and uploaded his own photos of pictures of them together with the caption: "By your side no matter what".

Queer Eye star Tan France commented: "Oh my gosh, Ashley. I'm sending all my prayers and love your way."

The couple sparked dating rumours in October when they were pictured together at an event.

Their characters began dating in the most recent season of Emily In Paris after they were introduced as long-lost school friends.

This week their co-star Lily Collins revealed filming has started on the latest season.

Pictured with a photo of a script, she wrote: "Did someone say Saison Quatre?! Finally reunited with my @emilyinparis fam back in Paris and it feels so good."
