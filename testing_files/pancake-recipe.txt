Good Old-Fashioned Pancakes
I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this
recipe card, this was a family favorite.
Ingredients
• 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
• 3 ½ teaspoons baking powder
• 1 tablespoon white sugar
• ¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste
• 1 ¼ cups milk
• 3 tablespoons butter, melted
• 1 egg
Directions
1. Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center
and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.
2. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the
griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges
are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with
remaining batter.
Editor's Note:
The salt amount has been reduced based on review feedback. The original recipe called for 1
teaspoon.
